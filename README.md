## General info
A e-commerce application's backend, built with Node.js and Express, would handle server-side tasks such as authenticating users, storing data, and responding to requests. It would use technologies like JWT and bcryptjs for authentication and password management, and mongoose to interact with a database. Middlewares like cors and helmet would handle CORS headers and secure the application, and dependencies like dotenv and validator would manage environment variables and validate data. These technologies would work together to build a backend that can handle requests, manage data, and authenticate users.
